/*
### 5️⃣ About the logs of your program:
1. 🔸 Any state change of a philosopher must be formatted as follows:
- `timestamp_in_ms` X has taken a fork
- `timestamp_in_ms` X is eating
- `timestamp_in_ms` X is sleeping
- `timestamp_in_ms` X is thinking
- `timestamp_in_ms` X died
2. 🔸 Replace `timestamp_in_ms` with the current timestamp in milliseconds and `X` with the philosopher number.
3. 🔸 A displayed state message should not be mixed up with another message.
4. 🔸 A message announcing a philosopher died should be displayed no more than 10 ms after the actual death of the philosopher.
